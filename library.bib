It is a process where sender sends encrypted message to the recipient. Symmetric encryption is known as the single key encryption. RSA algorithm is a symmetric key encryption.it uses public key and private key. Diffie Hellman cryptography is where both parties exchange secrets keys to encrypt message.},

@inproceedings{mdh,
   abstract = {The Classic Diffie-Hellman (CDH) algorithm encounters several security problems. The algorithm security depends on the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm and the integer factorization problem. The security also depends on the length of bits keys used. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm, the combination of Modified Diffie Hellman (MDH) with the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) algorithm. The MDH will not use primitive root (g). Instead, it will use two prime numbers (P and Q) for key exchange. It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. Furthermore, the MDH has an authentication mechanism. If both shared keys are equal, the communication will continue. Otherwise, it will stop because it is compromised. Also, the RSA algorithm will use the two prime numbers generated by MDH (P and Q). The RSA algorithm will perform the encryption and decryption message. The Diffie Hellman (DH) and the RSA Algorithms are the basis of several security standards and services on the internet, especially TLS and SSL. If the security of both algorithms is compromised, such systems will collapse. In this proposal, the combined cryptography system aims to achieve secret message exchange; it uses random prime numbers after multiplication and eventually shared with the other end of a communication. The proposed algorithm secretly generate a value so that the security level increases.},

@report{Chauhan2016,
   abstract = {In today's world, where Digital Communication is becoming an integral part of everyone's life, cyber security has become a challenge. There are various threats to the data being sent digitally. Changing the data into an unidentifiable form can protect it from attackers. Cryptography is about constructing protocols to prevent third party interventions. Various cryptographic techniques have been proposed to make the data transfer secure. Symmetric key algorithms are the widely used for encryption. The message to be transferred should be as small as possible so as to reduce space complexity that is why compression techniques find their applications in encryption. In this paper, a new approach to encrypt text files using a mix of Huffman coding, combination of symmetric key and public key cryptography and the binary operator XOR is proposed.},
