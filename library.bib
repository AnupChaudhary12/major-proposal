   abstract = {The Classic Diffie-Hellman (CDH) algorithm encounters several security problems. The algorithm security depends on the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm and the integer factorization problem. The security also depends on the length of bits keys used. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm, the combination of Modified Diffie Hellman (MDH) with the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) algorithm. The MDH will not use primitive root (g). Instead, it will use two prime numbers (P and Q) for key exchange. It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. Furthermore, the MDH has an authentication mechanism. If both shared keys are equal, the communication will continue. Otherwise, it will stop because it is compromised. Also, the RSA algorithm will use the two prime numbers generated by MDH (P and Q). The RSA algorithm will perform the encryption and decryption message. The Diffie Hellman (DH) and the RSA Algorithms are the basis of several security standards and services on the internet, especially TLS and SSL. If the security of both algorithms is compromised, such systems will collapse. In this proposal, the combined cryptography system aims to achieve secret message exchange; it uses random prime numbers after multiplication and eventually shared with the other end of a communication. The proposed algorithm secretly generate a value so that the security level increases.},

@report{Chauhan2016,
   abstract = {In today's world, where Digital Communication is becoming an integral part of everyone's life, cyber security has become a challenge. There are various threats to the data being sent digitally. Changing the data into an unidentifiable form can protect it from attackers. Cryptography is about constructing protocols to prevent third party interventions. Various cryptographic techniques have been proposed to make the data transfer secure. Symmetric key algorithms are the widely used for encryption. The message to be transferred should be as small as possible so as to reduce space complexity that is why compression techniques find their applications in encryption. In this paper, a new approach to encrypt text files using a mix of Huffman coding, combination of symmetric key and public key cryptography and the binary operator XOR is proposed.},

  abstract = {Chat applications have become one of the most important and popular applications on smartphones. It has the capability of exchange text messages, images and files which it cost free for the users to communicate with each other. All messages must be protected. The aim of the paper is to propose chat application that provides End-to-End security that let safely exchange private information with each other without worrying about data. In addition to the protection of storage. A list of requirements to make secure chat application is presented in this paper and based on these requirements, the application was designed. The proposed chat application was compared with other popular applications based on those requirements as well as it has been tested as a proof for providing End-to-End security.},

@report{Bodur2015,
  abstract = {The rapid development of communication technology, on the one hand, is bringing many technological conveniences with it and simplifying our lives. On the other hand, it has disadvantages on hiding the information that is continuously roaming through various communication media resources between senders and receivers and on not sharing them with third people. The aim of eliminating these disadvantages via specific security methods and algorithms is related to the discipline called cryptography, which includes information security. In this study, how RSA encryption algorithm and the secure messaging process on the SMS channel are realized in the devices with the Android operating system is examined thanks to the developed application. The advantages and the disadvantages of the application are demonstrated. The solution proposals are presented. The application is tested with different key sizes for fast and powerful messaging. The different key sizes which can be used for key generation processes and changes occurring on encrypted messages are mentioned. Also, existing alternative solutions to be used for the encryption process in secure messaging are stated.},
