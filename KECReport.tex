Data security is a crucial concern that ought to be managed to help protect vital data. Cryptography is one of the
conventional approaches for securing data and is generally considered a fundamental data security component that
provides privacy, integrity, confidentiality, and authentication.

In the current world where communication has been made easy such that you could talk to a person on the other side of the world with a press of the button. With the increase in availability of internet service you can send texts, photos ,files through the internet in a matter of seconds and for far less cheaper. This is achieved through different chat applications. With the increased usage of such chat applications the contents of such messages contains more that just simple messages to friends and families but also very important information and files which on the wrong hands could cause a huge catastrophe. As such End-to-End security is needed to safely exchange private information with each other without worrying about data. With this project we aim to provide an End-to-End encrypted chat apps with file compression feature. List of requirements to make such application are provided in this paper.\cite{Chauhan2016}

This project approach End-to-end encryption method to provide  secure communication that prevents third parties from accessing data while it's transferred from one end system or device to another.
The end-to-end encryption method is implemented using the Asymmetric key encryption algorithm (RSA). We compressed the message using huffman Encoding algorithm. Then used RSA to encrypt that encoded data. The login system is also secured because we used AES library to secure the password.

In this way we can maintain the data more securely.
Since we used huffman to compress the data and RSA algorithm for securing the data.\cite{sa}

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}\label{sec:bkgrnd}%label your section if you require to refer them somewhere else in your document.
With the rapid development of mobile devices, computers and accessibility to the internet there is growing users of different chat applications. The attracting or more so important features of any social media has become the chat feature. Such chat features provide real time messaging, file sharing which may include different photos, videos, documents, etc. Chatting has been such an important aspect of the modern world that it is expected the no. of active users currently is in billions with this number expected to increase more in the coming years. Among some of the popular chat applications Whatsapp’s monthly active users(in millions) are 2000, messenger 988, snapchat 557 to name a few.\cite{Barakat2018}

The importance of such apps was never more clearly presented as when Facebook experienced outage in 2021. In what was just a 6 hour long outage the competing apps like telegram gained a record 70 million new users.
As the dependence on chat systems grow day by day the vulnerability and assaults also increases. As such  there is increasing need to implement a secure communication

Digital communication witnesses a noticeable and continuous development in
many applications in the Internet. Hence, secure communication sessions must be
provided. The security of data transmitted across a global network has turned into a
key factor on the network performance measures. So, the confidentiality and the
integrity of data are needed to prevent eavesdroppers from accessing and using
transmitted data.

One way of to secure the communication is using End-To-End encryption which use the Cryptographic algorithm. Cryptographic algorithms are divided
into symmetric and asymmetric keys. The symmetric algorithms require a single key only for the
encryption and decryption of data. Asymmetric algorithms on the other hand require both public
and private keys for the encryption and decryption of data. The scrambling of the data is done
using the public key while the private key is made known only to the receiver which is meant for
the decryption of the data.
A maiden asymmetric algorithm was proposed by Diffie-Hellman  which ensures secured
communication as well as data security. A counter algorithm termed RSA which has lower time
complexity based on prime number factorization was proposed in 1977 and is the patent of Ron
Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman (RSA), which was published in 1978 at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology . In this algorithm, two prime numbers are used to produce the public
and the private key. When the keys are created, the prime numbers are no more considered and
are or can be discarded.\cite{sa}

\section{Problem statement}
\vspace{-18pt}
The purpose of this project is to provide the correct data with security to the users. For
some of the users the data might be lost during the transmission process in the network
and for some, the data might be changed by the unauthorized person in the network and
there are some other security problems in the network. Our application will give you more
Security to the data present in the network and there will be able to reduce the loss of data
in the network which will be transmitted from the sender to the receiver using the latest
technologies. Only the Authorized persons i.e., who are using our application will be
there in the Network.

The proposed algorithm is to compress the message at one end and ask the public key of another person and use that public key to encrypt the message and the person only decrypt the message using his private key.Using Huffman encoding the message compressed is loss less.

\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Related Paper}
There are currently millions of monthly active users worldwide of different chat applications currently. There are two types of architecture in those applications, client-server and peer-to-peer networks. In a peer-to-peer network, there is no central server and each user has his/her own data storage. On the contrary, there are dedicated servers and clients in a client-server network and the data is stored on a central server. Security and privacy in chat applications have a paramount importance but few people take it seriously. In a test done by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, most of the popular messaging applications failed to meet most security standards. These applications might be using the conversations as an information for certain purposes. Moreover, reading the private conversations is certainly unacceptable in terms of privacy.  Most applications only used Transport Layer Security (TLS) for securing channel, the service provider has full access to every message exchanged through their infrastructure . Therefore, these messages can be accessed by attackers. Therefore to maintain protection and privacy, messages should be encrypted from sender to receiver and no one can read messages even the service provider, in addition to protecting the local storage of the device.[1]\\
There are different Encryption algorithms that can  be utilized  to  provide secure  messaging environment. Thus, messages will circulate as  encrypted form in transmission medium, not as clear text. Somebody who has seized encrypted data does not obtain original message from the encrypted  data  unless they  possess  the  necessary  method or  a  key.  Encryption  methods  are divided into the following categories: private key cryptography and public key cryptography.\\
In a symmetric key algorithm, the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and keep secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses  the  same  key  for  decryption.  In  this  case,  except  for  transmitted  encrypted  message, encryption  key  must  also  be  submitted  confidentially,  which  is  one  of  the  disadvantages of private-key cryptography.
If a third person who has managed to enter the system operator or listen to transmission medium
seizes the  key value,  s/he can turn  the  encrypted data into  original data.  The most  important feature of public key cryptography which is another method is that the key value used to encrypt the message is different from the key value used to decrypt the message. Each user has two keys
in this method: public key and private key. The public key of the user can be viewed by anyone.
The private key is kept secret by the user. When someone wants to send a message to user, they
use the user's public key and create the encrypted message and then send the encrypted data to
user. The user  decrypts the  encrypted data with  her/his private  key  and obtains  a meaningful
message.\\
The data which has been encrypted by the user’s public key is only solved with the user’s private key. When the user wants to send a message, s/he reaches the public key library. S/he takes the public key of somebody to which s/he wants to send a message and encrypts the message and then s/he sends the encrypted message to the receiver. The only thing that the receiver must do is to solve the message with his/her own private key. DH protocol is to enable two users to exchange a secret key securely that can be used for subsequent encryption of messages. The protocol itself is limited to the exchange of the keys. But because of having no entity authentication mechanism, DH protocol is easily attacked by the man-in-the-middle attack and impersonation attack in practice. The DH key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to establish together a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. Then they use this key to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.cite{mdh}\\
The Classic Diffie-Hellman (CDH) algorithm encounters several security problems. The algorithm security depends on the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm and the integer factorization problem. The security also depends on the length of bits keys used. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm, the combination of Modified Diffie Hellman (MDH) with the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) algorithm. The MDH will not use primitive root (g). Instead, it will use two prime numbers (P and Q) for key exchange. It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. Furthermore, the MDH has an authentication mechanism. If both shared keys are equal, the communication will continue. Otherwise, it will stop because it is compromised. Also, the RSA algorithm will use the two prime numbers generated by MDH (P and Q). RSA algorithm, which is one of the public-key encryption methods and more reliable than the private key encryption algorithms, is used for secure messaging.[4]\\
RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. The RSA algorithm will perform the encryption and decryption message. The Diffie Hellman (DH) and the RSA Algorithms are the basis of several security standards and services on the internet, especially TLS and SSL. If the security of both algorithms is compromised, such systems will collapse. In this proposal, the combined cryptography system aims to achieve secret message exchange; it uses random prime numbers after multiplication and eventually shared with the other end of a communication. The proposed algorithm secretly generate a value so that the security level increases .\cite{mdh} \\
Security of RSA depends on the prime factorization of N. The proposed algorithm authenticates a user as shown is the first part of the algorithm by exchange value of random P and Q. Another strength of the hybrid algorithm, it will not generate primitive root (g). Then generate secret keys at both sides. Secret keys not known or not sent over a communication channel, so eavesdropper has no chance to get the value of the secret key. The secret key is multiplied to P, and hence new P will be not identifiable to attacker though the value of P gets compromised. This value of P and Q is generated secretly at the user side, and this valued is not shared through the communication channel, so we claim that the proposed method is more secure than the original RSA. The disadvantage of the proposed algorithm has extra steps that mix symmetric key and asymmetric key cryptography. The time required for this integration steps is disadvantageous of this proposed method. But we can achieve better security\cite{mdh}


\section{Existing system:}
In this section we briefly introduce many of the popular chat applications. Some of these applications are not public or open source so it is difficult for these to get evaluated by the developer’s community, security experts or research academic.

\subsection{Viber}
Viber is an instant messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) application for smartphones developed by Viber Media. In addition to instant messaging, users can exchange images,
video and audio media messages. Viber recently supported the end-to-end encryption to their service, but only for one-to-one and group conversations in which all
participants are using the latest Viber version 6.0 for Android, iOS or Windows 10. At this time, in the Viber iOS application for iPhone and iPad, attachments such as images and videos which are sent via the iOS Share Extension does not support end-to-end encryption .\cite{shyam} Viber has privacy issues such as adding a friend without his knowledge or adding him to a group without his permission. Plus that, local storage is not secured. It is not
open source making it difficult to evaluation.

\subsection{Whatsapp}
WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging application, recently enabled end-to-end encryption for its 1 billion users across all platforms. WhatsApp uses part of a security protocol developed by Open Whisper System, so provides a security-verification code that can share with a contact to ensure that the conversation is encrypted. It is difficult to trust in WhatsApp application completely because the application is not open source, making it difficult to verify the functioning process and match them with the work of the encryption protocol which was announced. .\cite{e2echat}

\subsection{Telegram}
Telegram is an open source instant messaging service enables users to send messages, photos, videos, stickers and files. Telegram provides two modes of messaging
is regular chat and secret chat. Regular chat is client-server based on cloud-based messaging, it does not provide end-to-end encryption, stores all messages on its
servers and synchronizes with all user devices. More, local storage is not encrypted by default. Secret chat is client-client provides end-to-end encryption. Contrary to regular chat messages, messages that are sent in a secret chat can only be accessed on the device that has been initiated a secret chat and the device that has been accepted a secret chat they cannot be accessed on other devices. Messages sent within secret chats can be deleted.\cite{de}
at any time and can optionally self-destruct. Telegram uses its own cryptographic protocol MTProto which is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange, and has been criticized by a significant part of the cryptographic community about its security. The registration process of Telegram, Viber and WhatsApp depend on SMS. SMS is transported via Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol. The vulnerability lies in SS7. Attackers exploited SS7 protocol to login into
victim's account by intercepting SMS messages. Because of Telegram cloud-based, the attacker exploits it and makes full control of the victim account and can prevent him to enter into his account. To make the account more secure should activate two-factor authentication \cite{telegram}

\subsection{Facebook Messenger}
Facebook Messenger is a popular messaging service
available for Android and iOS. It provides two modes of
messaging one is regular chat and another is secret conversations.
Regular chat does not provide end-to-end encryption only
secure communication by using TLS,  and it stores all
messages on its servers. Secret conversations have  the
same idea of Telegram secret chat . .\cite{fb}




\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Required Algorithm:}

\subsection{Overview of  Diffie Hellman Algorithm}
The algorithm is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, a method of doing public-key cryptography based on the algebra structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. The DH also uses the trapdoor function, just like many other ways to do public-key cryptography. The simple idea of understanding to the DH Algorithm is the following.

\subsection{Diffie Hellman Algorithm Steps:}
\vspace{-18pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first party picks two prime numbers, g and p and tells them to the second party.
	\item The second party then picks a secret number (let’s call it a), and then it computes $g^a$ mod p and sends the result back to the first party; let’s call the result A. Keep in mind that the secret number is not sent to anyone, only the result is.
	\item Then the first party does the same; it selects a secret number b and calculates the result B=$g^b$ mod p similar to the step 2.
	\item Then, this result is sent to the second party.
	\item  The second party takes the received number B and calculates $K_{a}$= $B^a$ mod p
	\item The first party takes the received number A and calculates $K_{b}$ = $A^b$ mod p.

\subsection{Overview of RSA Algorithm}
RSA encryption algorithm, which is based on the idea of ensuring the secure transfer of data in the digital environment and the algorithmic difficulty of separating the integer factorization, is a type of public-key encryption method. Nowadays, it is also known as both the most commonly used encryption method and the method that allows digital signatures. It was created by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman  in 1978. Prime numbers are used for key generation process in RSA encryption method.This makes it possible to create a safer structure. How the encryption and decryption processes
are done with RSA algorithm is shown in below figure,

\subsection{RSA algorithm structure}
\subsubsection{Steps:}
\vspace{-18pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Choose two very large random prime integers: p and q
	\item Calculate n = p*q and z = (p-1)(q-1)
	\item Choose a number e where 1 $<$ e $<$ z
	\item Calculate d = e-1mod(p-1)(q-1)
	\item You can bundle private key pair as (n,d)
	\item You can bundle public key pair as (n,e)
\end{itemize}
After creating public and private keys, information which must be sent is encrypted with the
public key.
\subsubsection{Encryption and decryption processes are done as follows:}
\vspace{-18pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The cypher text C is found by the equation where M is the original
	      message
	\item The message M can be found from the cypher text C by the equation M = C$^d$ mod n
	\item A text encrypted with the public key can only be solved with the private key
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
\subsection{Proposed algorithm}
\subsubsection{Steps:}
\vspace{-18pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Alice(User A) and Bob (User B) Choose two very large random prime integers: s and r
	\item Calculate n = s*r and z = (s-1)(r-1)
	\item Choose a small exponent say e :
	      \subitem But e Must be
	      \subitem An integer.
	      \subitem Not be a factor of n.
	      \subitem 1 $<$ e $<$ z

	\item Calculate d = e$^{-1}$ mod(p-1)(q-1) or d = (k*z + 1) / e

	\item Public key will contain (n , e) and private key will contain
	      (n , d).
	\item Alice needs to identify Bob. For the authentication
	      process Alice and Bob use Modified Diffie-Hellman
	      algorithm
	\item Alice and Bob choose two large prime p,g such as g$<$p.
	\item Alice chooses a large random number x$_{1} (0<x_{1}<p)$ and computes $R_{1} = g^{x_{1}} mod p.$
	\item Alice sends $R_{1}$ to Bob
	\item Bob chooses a large random number x$_{2} (0<x_{2}<p)$ and computes $R_{2} = g^{x_{2}} mod p.$
	\item  Bob computes $K_{Bob} = R_{1}^{x_{2}} mod p$
	      and $E_{1}=Encrypt(R_{2},K_{Bob}).$
	\item Bob sends $R_{2},E_{1}$ to Alice.
	\item Alice computes $K_{Alice} = R_{2}^{x_{1}} mod p$
	      and $R^{'}_{2}=Decrypt(E_{1},K_{Alice}).$
	\item If $R_{2}=R^{'}_{2}$ she proceeds; otherwise the verifier is
	      dishonest.
	\item Alice lets Bob send his public key.
	\item Bob encrypts his public key via the secret key $(K_{Bob})$ and
	      sends it to Alice.
	\item Alice decrypts Bob's public key via the secret key $(K_{Alice})$
	\item Alice encrypt message with Bob’s public key and sends
	      it to Bob.
	\item Bob decrypts the message via the secret key $(K_{Bob})$
	\item Now Bob has the original message.

There are two main steps in the suggested algorithm: user
authentication and encryption. These steps have been shown in figure below:

\subsection{Security analysis}
Man in the Middle attack and Discrete Logarithm attacks
are the most damaging attacks in key-exchanging process.
Furthermore, Cycle attack, Brute Force attack, and Timing
attack are the most important attacks during the encryption
and decryption process. The following step evaluates the
algorithm against these attacks.
\subsubsection{Man in the Middle Attack}
Man in the Middle is an attack that the attacker is able to
read and modify all the messages between Alice and Bob [16].
To protect the suggested model from Man in the Middle
attack, encrypted replies $(R_{1},R_{2})$ and mutual
authentication between Alice  and Bob  is
required. For this purpose Bob computes
$K_{Bob} = R_{1}^{x_{2}} mod p$
and $E_{1}=Encrypt(R_{2},K_{Bob})$ and sends $ R_{2},E_{1}$ to Alice.
After that, Alice computes $K_{Alice} = R_{2}^{x_{1}} mod p$
and $R^{'}_{2}=Decrypt(E_{1},K_{Alice}).$
These processes prevented the Man in the Middle attack and by comparing $R_{2}$ and $R^{'}_{2}$ the attack will be identified. The following figure shows the Man in the Middle attack prevention in the proposed model.

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=160mm]{images/maninmiddle.png}{}
	\caption{ Man in the Middle Attack Prevention by Proposed Algorithm} %figure name
	\label{figmaninmiddle} % for referencing
\end{figure}

According to the figure, $R_{m}$ and $R^{'}_{m}$ are not same for
Alice because the keys between users and attackers are
different.\\
{$K_{Alice} = g^{x_{1}{x_{m}}}$ mod p}\\
{$K_{Bob} = g^{x_{2}{x_{m}}}$ mod p}\\
{$K_{Eve} = g^{x_{2}{x_{m}}}$ mod p}\\
It means $K_{Alice}$ $\neq$ $K_{Bob}$ = $K_{Eve}$  and because of that, the
Man in the Middle attack was noticed by Alice and the attack
was prevented.

\subsubsection{Cycle Attack }
Cycle Attack is an attack where the attacker encrypts the
cipher text alternately, until the original text appears. This
number of encrypting will decrypt any cipher text. In large key
RSA, this attack could not be practical even when a
generalisation of the attack allows the modulus to be factored
and most of the time it works faster. Moreover, in the
proposed model, the attacker will not have access to the public
key to re-encrypt the cipher text because the public key has
been encrypted by the secret key that was generated in
Modified Diffie-Hellman process.

\subsubsection{Brute Force Attack}
All possible combinations to guess the private key have
been tried by the attacker during Brute Force attack. In
original RSA, the probability of failure against this attack can
be decreased considerably by choosing exponents larger than
2048 bits but with the combination of the proposed model, this
algorithm has significant resistance towards brute force attack
even with 1024 bits exponents because of the encryption of
the public key before sending it.

\subsubsection{Timing Attack}
Timing attack is a side channel attack in which the attacker
determines private exponent by calculating the time by
exploiting the timing variation of the modular exponentiation
	[18]. Timing attack in original RSA might be prevented by
including a random delay to the exponentiation algorithm or
multiplying the cipher-text with a random number [19] while
the dual encryption (public key encryption by secret key and
the message encryption by RSA ) in the suggested model
will protect the transferred message from the timing attack and
it is not necessary to multiply the cipher-text.

\subsection{CIA triad}
CIA triad is one of the most important models which is designed to guide policies
for information security within an organization.
CIA stands for :\\
Confidentiality,
Integrity,
Availability.\\
In this project, we only focuses on two models Confidentiality and 	integrity.\\
Confidentiality means that only authorized individuals/systems can view sensitive or classified information. The data being sent over the network should not be accessed by unauthorized individuals.We used Encryption to protect the data.\\

The next is integrity, data cannot be modified by third party. Corruption of data is a failure to maintain data integrity. We verified that we are sending message to a genuine person so no tampering of message will happen. To check if our data has been modified or not, we make use of a hash function.

\subsubsection{First Increment:}
First, the website was analyzed to know how it should look like.
Then, the designing of templates was done. After observing the design of the
templates, we started coding using react js, bootstrap, JavaScript.

\subsubsection{Second Increment:}
After analyzing the scenario of the project, the algorithms to be
implemented was analyzed. Using the algorithms, we started designing
the algorithms that is suitable for the project. Initiating the coding we
completed the algorithm implementation.
Finally, the algorithm was implemented.

\subsubsection{Third Increment:}
After the algorithm implementation backend designing and coding
was started. Using Django and Python the backend part
was completed and tested. Finally, backend was ready.

\subsubsection{Fourth Increment:}
Finally, after all the designing was completed, coding for the project was done. Later,
testing of the project was done.
At last, the final webapp was designed.

\section{Work on Progress:}
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a working model of secure end to end chat web-app. This will include a working web client for user login and chat in real time using socket.io . We have finished creating login and signup system with a working frontend and backend.

\section {Work Remaining:}
We are still working on the backend and frontend  of the chat system. We also have to implement working algorithm of end to end encryption. We also have designing of UI, coding, testing and documentation and report of the project remaining.

\section{Work Schedule}
Scheduling establishes the timelines, delivery and availability of project resources whether they be personnel, inventory or capital. For this reason, any project without a schedule is a project doomed to issue down the road.
