   abstract = {In today's world, where Digital Communication is becoming an integral part of everyone's life, cyber security has become a challenge. There are various threats to the data being sent digitally. Changing the data into an unidentifiable form can protect it from attackers. Cryptography is about constructing protocols to prevent third party interventions. Various cryptographic techniques have been proposed to make the data transfer secure. Symmetric key algorithms are the widely used for encryption. The message to be transferred should be as small as possible so as to reduce space complexity that is why compression techniques find their applications in encryption. In this paper, a new approach to encrypt text files using a mix of Huffman coding, combination of symmetric key and public key cryptography and the binary operator XOR is proposed.},

@report{Sabah2017,
  abstract = {Chat applications have become one of the most important and popular applications on smartphones. It has the capability of exchange text messages, images and files which it cost free for the users to communicate with each other. All messages must be protected. The aim of the paper is to propose chat application that provides End-to-End security that let safely exchange private information with each other without worrying about data. In addition to the protection of storage. A list of requirements to make secure chat application is presented in this paper and based on these requirements, the application was designed. The proposed chat application was compared with other popular applications based on those requirements as well as it has been tested as a proof for providing End-to-End security.},
